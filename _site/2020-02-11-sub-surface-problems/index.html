<p>Tech entrepreneurs often inhabit a very narrow demographic, and they often scratch their own itch or solve problems they see around them.</p>

<p>Because of that, there are a disproportionate amount or productivity and dating apps out there. These problems that a majority of entrepreneurs have I call “surface problems”.</p>

<p>With good timing and a novel approach, there is a lot of money to be made, but you’ll have to deal with a ton of competition.</p>

<p>The alternative to solving surface problems is to solve… you guessed it… “sub-surface problems”.
These are problems you can’t know about without being an insider in a specific scene or industry.</p>

<p>Often they require insider knowledge, which heightens the bar for entry.</p>

<p>For example, if you aren’t a magician you won’t know what magicians need or how much money magicians spend on magic tricks and fancy playing cards. The answer is A LOT.</p>

<p>Solving these problems come with a bunch of advantages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Less sexy or more fringe often means less competition.</li>
  <li>Approaching an industry with beginner’s eyes can give you a leg-up. What looks obvious to you might be foreign to everyone else.</li>
  <li>If you’re lucky, the scene or industry can go mainstream, giving you a huge advantage over the incoming competition. A great example of this is computers. Back in the day, they were the interests of scientists and hobbyists. Today they power our entire economy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead of building another me-to app, flirt with fringe ideas and interests. Eventually, you’ll bump into product ideas with highly motivated markets ready to take your money.</p>
