          <h2>How is college mathematics different from high
          school math?</h2>
          <p>In high school mathematics much of your time was spent learning algorithms
          and manipulative techniques which you were expected to be able to apply
          in certain well-defined situations. This limitation of material and expectations
          for your performance has probably led you to develop study habits which
          were appropriate for high school mathematics but may be insufficient for
          college mathematics. This can be a source of much frustration for you and
          for your instructors. My object in writing this essay is to help ease this
          frustration by describing some study strategies which may help you channel
          your abilities and energies in a productive direction.</p>

          <p>The first major difference between high school mathematics and college
          mathematics is the amount of emphasis on what the student would call theory---the
          precise statement of definitions and theorems and the logical processes
          by which those theorems are established. To the mathematician this material,
          together with examples showing why the definitions chosen are the correct
          ones and how the theorems can be put to practical use, is the essence of
          mathematics. A course description using the term ``rigorous'' indicates
          that considerable care will be taken in the statement of definitions and
          theorems and that proofs will be given for the theorems rather than just
          plausibility arguments. If your approach is to go straight to the problems
          with only cursory reading of the ``theory'' this aspect of college math
          will cause difficulties for you.</p>

          <p>The second difference between college mathematics and high school mathematics
          comes in the approach to technique and application problems. In high school
          you studied one technique at a time---a problem set or unit might deal,
          for instance, with solution of quadratic equations by factoring or by use
          of the quadratic formula, but it wouldn't teach both and ask you to decide
          which was the better approach for particular problems. To be sure, you
          learn individual techniques well in this approach, but you are unlikely
          to learn how to attack a problem for which you are not told what technique
          to use or which is not exactly like other applications you have seen. College
          mathematics will offer many techniques which can be applied for a particular
          type of problem---individual problems may have many possible approaches,
          some of which work better than others. Part of the task of working such
          a problem lies in choosing the appropriate technique. This requires study
          habits which develop judgment as well as technical competence.
          </p>
          <p>We will take up the problem of how to study mathematics by considering
          specific aspects individually. First we will consider definitions---first
          because they form the foundation for any part of mathematics and are essential
          for understanding theorems. Then we'll take up theorems, lemmas, propositions,
          and corollaries and how to study the way the subject fits together. The
          subject of proofs, how to decipher them and why we need them, comes next.
          And finally, we will discuss development of judgment in problem solving.</p>

          <h2><a name="definitions"></a>What should you do with a definition?</h2>
          <p>A definition in mathematics is a precise statement delineating and naming
          a concept by relating it to previously defined concepts or such undefined
          concepts as ``number'' or ``set.'' Careful definitions are necessary so
          that we know exactly what we are talking about. Unfortunately, for many
          of the concepts in undergraduate mathematics the definition is rather difficult
          to understand, so often at low levels an intuitive feeling for the meaning
          of a term is all that is given or required. This intuitive feeling, while
          necessary, is not sufficient at the college level. This means that you
          need to grapple with and master the formal statement of definitions and
          their meanings. How do you do it?</p>
          <br>

          <h3>Step 1. Make sure you understand what the definition says.</h3>

          <p>This sounds obvious, but it can cause some difficulties, particularly for
          definitions with complicated logical structure (like the definition of
          the limit of a function at a point in its domain). Definitions are not
          a good place to practice your speed reading. In general there are no wasted
          words or extraneous symbols in established definitions and the easily overlooked
          small words like <i>and, or, if ... then, for all,</i> and <i>there is</i>
          are your clues to the logical structure of the definition.</p>

          <p>First determine what general class of things is being talked about:
          the definition of a polynomial describes a particular kind of algebraic
          expression; the definition of a continuous function specifies a kind of
          function; the definition of a basis for a vector space specifies a kind
          of set of vectors.</p>

          <p>Next decipher the logical structure of the definition. What do you have
          to do to show that a member of your general class of things satisfies the
          definition: what do you have to do to show that an expression is a polynomial,
          or a function is continuous, or a set of vectors is a basis.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2. Determine the scope of the definition with examples.</h3>

          <p>Most definitions have standard examples that go with them. While these
          are useful, they may lead you to expect that all examples look like the
          standard example. To understand a definition you should make up your own
          examples: find three examples that do satisfy the definition but which
          are as different as possible from each other; find two examples of items
          in the general class described by the definition which do not satisfy it.
          Prove that your five examples do what you think they do---such proofs are
          usually short, follow the structure of the definition quite closely, and
          help immensely in understanding the definition. These examples should be
          neatly written up so that you can refer to them later. Your own examples
          will have more meaning for you than mine or the book's when it comes time
          to review.</p>



          <h3>Step 3. Memorize the exact wording of the definition.</h3>

          <p>This step may sound petty, but the use of definitions demands knowledge
          of exactly what they say. For this reason you can count on being asked
          for the statement of any definition on an exam. The importance of precise
          wording should have been made clear by your examples in step 2 and it certainly
          is essential in the proof of theorems.</p>

          <p>Solid knowledge of definitions is more than a third of the battle. Time
          spent gaining such knowledge is not wasted.</p>

          <h2><a name="theorems"></a>Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas, and Corollaries</h2>

          <p>Occasionally definitions are useful in and of themselves, but usually we
          need to relate them to each other and to general problems before they can
          be made to work for us. This is the role of theory.</p>

          <p>The relative importance and the intended use of statements which are
          then proved is hinted at by the names they are given. Theorems are usually
          important results which show how to make concepts solve problems or give
          major insights into the workings of the subject. They often have involved
          and deep proofs. Propositions give smaller results, often relating different
          definitions to each other or giving alternate forms of the definition.
          Proofs of propositions are usually less complex than the proofs of theorems.
          Lemmas are technical results used in the proofs of theorems. Often it is
          found that the same trick is used several times in one proof or in the
          proof of several theorems. When this happens the trick is isolated in a
          lemma so that its proof will not have to be repeated every time it is used.
          This often makes the proofs of theorems shorter and, one hopes, more lucid.
          Corollaries are immediate consequences of theorems either giving special
          cases or highlighting the interest and importance of the theorem. If the
          author or instructor has been careful (not all authors and instructors
          are) with the use of these labels, they will help you figure out what is
          important in the subject.</p>
          <p>The steps to understanding and mastering a theorem follow the same lines
          as the steps to understanding a definition.</p>

          <h3>Step 1. Make sure you understand what the theorem says.</h3>

          <p>Part of this is a vocabulary problem. Theorems use terms which have been
          given precise meanings by definitions. So you may need to review the definitions
          to understand the words in a theorem.</p>

          <p>Next you need to understand the logical structure of the theorem: what
          are the hypotheses and what are the conclusions? If you have several hypotheses,
          must they all be satisfied (that is, do they have an&nbsp; <b><i>and</i></b>
          between them) or will it suffice to have only some of them (an&nbsp; <b><i>or</i></b>
          between them)? In most cases theorems require that all of their hypotheses
          be satisfied. A theorem tells you nothing about a situation which does
          not satisfy the hypothesis. The hypothesis tells you what you must show
          in order for the theorem to apply to a particular case. The conclusions
          tell you what the theorem tells you about each case.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2. Determine how the theorem is used.</h3>

          <p>This involves finding examples of problems for which the theorem gives
          a technique for finding the answer. Make up your own problems and show
          how the theorem helps with them. Again writing this down will help solidify
          the theorem in your mind and make it easier to review.</p>

          <h3>Step 3. Find out what the hypotheses are doing there.</h3>

          <p>This is a little tricky and is probably more important in advanced courses
          than in beginning courses. What you do is find examples (either your own
          or someone else's) to show that if individual hypotheses are omitted the
          conclusion can be false. For instance, in calculus many theorems have a
          hypothesis that the functions involved be continuous; why does the theorem
          fail if this hypothesis is left out? Usually an example will make this
          clearer than an examination of how the hypothesis was used in the proof
          will. A catalog of such examples can be very useful. See for instance the
          books Counterexamples in Analysis and Counterexamples in Topology.</p>

          <p>In some cases a hypothesis is included just because it makes an otherwise
          complicated proof easy. This means that you may not be able to find examples
          which illustrate that each hypothesis is essential.</p>

          <h3>Step 4. Memorize the statement of the theorem.</h3>

          <p>If you are going to use a theorem you need to know exactly what it says.
          Pay particular attention to hypotheses. We will take up proofs later, but
          for now let me note that it is not a good idea to try to memorize the proof
          of a theorem. What you want to do is understand the proof well enough that
          you can prove the theorem yourself.</p>

          <h2><a name="fit"></a>Fitting the subject together</h2>

          <p>Mathematics is not a collection of miscellaneous techniques but rather
          a way of thinking---a unified subject. Part of the task of studying mathematics
          is getting the various definitions and theorems properly related to each
          other. This is particularly important at the end of a course, but it will
          help you make sense of the content and organization of a subject if you
          keep the overall organization in mind as you go along. There are two techniques
          I know of which help with this process: working backwards and definition-theorem
          outlines.</p>


          <h3>Step 1. Working backwards</h3>

          <p>In general there is very little difficulty recognizing a major result when
          you get to it. A good way of seeing how a subject works is to examine the
          proof of a major result and see what previous results were used in it.
          Then trace these results back to earlier results used to prove them. Eventually
          you will work your way back to definitions (unless there are theorems given
          without proof---in calculus, for instance, the proof of the intermediate
          value theorem is often omitted because it requires a deeper understanding
          of the real numbers than is usually available at the beginning of calculus
          1). This information can be put into a sort of genealogy chart for results
          which helps you see at a glance how the results fit together. It helps
          to have descriptive names for your theorems and lemmas. Such a chart might
          look sort of like this:</p>

          <p><strong>Add unordered list</strong></p>


          <p>With such a road map through the theory you should be able to tell how
          you got where you are, if not where you are headed.</p>

          <h3>Step 2. Make a definition-theorem outline.</h3>
          <p>After you have worked backwards to the definitions for each of your major
          theorems in a section you should have a good idea of which results are
          needed before others can be proved. Some definitions will not make sense
          until certain theorems are proved (dimension of a vector space is an example:
          you can't give a number a name until you know you are talking about a unique
          number, and that requires a theorem). A definition theorem outline is an
          arrangement of the results in an order so that each result is introduced
          before it is needed in a proof. It should contain the precise statements
          of all definitions and theorems and a sketch of the proof of each theorem.
          A sketch of a proof will show which earlier results were used and how they
          were combined. It will usually omit calculations simplifying forms of expressions
          and routine checks that hypotheses are satisfied. This outline is both
          a good way to start a review and a useful thing to have to refer to.</p>

          <h2><a name="proofs"></a>How to make sense of a proof</h2>

          <p>College level mathematics demands that the student work through (or at
          least sit through) many proofs. This is often unpopular, I think largely
          because it is hard work to follow a proof, hard work of an unfamiliar kind.
          Proof is largely absent or at most optional in high school math; it is
          neither absent nor optional in college mathematics.</p>

          <h3>Step 1. Make sure you know what the theorem says.</h3>

          <p>If you have the hypotheses mixed up with the conclusions you will not know
          what assumptions may be made nor will you know what conclusion you are
          trying to reach.</p>

          <h3>Step 2. Make a general outline of the proof.</h3>

          <p>This is what you would do in a definition theorem outline. See what the
          previous results used are and find out what the basic strategy of the proof
          is. On this pass through omit the details, else you miss the direction
          of the road by too close examination of the bricks in the pavement.</p>

          <p>Most theorems have the form of implications: if the hypotheses are true,
          then the conclusion follows. The easiest structure for a proof to use is
          to assume the hypotheses and combine them, using previous results, to reach
          the conclusion through a chain of implications. Some proofs use other strategies:
          contrapositive argument, reductio ad absurdum, mathematical induction,
          perhaps even Zorn's lemma (a form of the axiom of choice). The more complicated
          kinds of proofs will need to be discussed in class.</p>

          <h3>Step 3. Fill in all of the details.</h3>

          <p>Once you understand the strategy of the proof concentrate on its tactics.
          Almost all expositions of proofs in undergraduate mathematics textbooks
          (and all expositions at higher levels) leave out many routine steps. An
          expression will be simplified without showing exactly how to get from one
          line to the next. Fill in these details. A theorem will be quoted and applied
          without explicitly checking all of its hypotheses. Check them. Some parts
          of the proof will be outlined with the details left to the reader. Put
          in those details. When you finish you should know why each step follows
          from what came before. You may not see how anyone could have thought to
          do the proof that way, but you should be able to see that it is correct.</p>

          <h4>Why bother with proofs at all?</h4>

          <p>For the mathematics major this question is easy to answer---a large portion
          of mathematics consists of proofs. The mathematician enjoys the logical
          puzzle which must be solved to find a proof and obtains aesthetic satisfaction
          from elegance in proofs. The student who wants to major in mathematics
          should do so because of ability in deciphering and producing proofs and
          enjoyment derived from proof well done. The major should also have skill
          in solving problems and finding applications as well.</p>

          <p>But many of you will say ``I'm not a math major; I want applications
          so that I can use tools from mathematics in my field'' or ``I'm just taking
          this course because it's a requirement in my major and I sort of liked
          math in high school.'' Why should you learn about proof?</p>

          <p>The applications you meet in other fields are not likely to look exactly
          like the math textbook applications, which are chosen for their appeal
          to a traditional audience (largely engineers) and for their representative
          character. Other applications work similarly, though not exactly the same
          way. This means that you need to learn how to apply the concepts in your
          math courses to situations not discussed in those courses. (There is no
          way that a course could discuss every possible known application: about
          500 papers appear every two weeks with applications, and those are just
          the applications published in the ``mathematical'' literature!) To do so
          you need the best possible understanding of the mathematics you want to
          apply. Certainly this means that you need to know the hypotheses of theorems
          so that you don't apply them where they won't work. It is helpful to know
          the proof so that you can see how to circumvent the failed hypothesis if
          necessary. One of the major pitfalls of applied mathematics, particularly
          as practiced by nonmathematicians, is the danger of conveniently overlooking
          the assumptions of a mathematical model. (Mathematicians trying to do applied
          mathematics are more likely to fall into the trap of making models which
          have no relationship to reality.)</p>

          <p>Many applications consist of recognizing the definition of a mathematical
          concept phrased in the terms of another discipline---the more familiar
          you are with the definition, the more likely you are to be able to recognize
          the disguised version elsewhere. The nuances of definitions are made most
          clear in the proofs of propositions relating definitions and pointing out
          unexpected equivalent variants, some of which may look more like a situation
          in another discipline than the precise form used in your math class.</p>

          <p>Arguments for theory as an aid to application rest on an obvious premise:
          it is much easier to apply something you understand thoroughly. This is,
          however, a better argument for care in learning the statements of theorems
          than it is for spending time understanding proofs. The best justification
          for the inclusion of proof in math classes is more philosophical:</p>

          <h3>Proof is the ultimate test of validity in mathematics.</h3>

          <p>Once one accepts the logical processes involved in a proof no further
          observation or change in fashion will change the validity of a mathematical
          result. No other discipline has such an immutable criterion for validity.</p>

          <p>The major benefit derived from an education is the ability to think
          clearly and make considered judgment. Each discipline should teach a body
          of material, appropriate modes of thought in dealing with that material,
          and a means for determining the validity of the conclusions reached. A
          chemistry curriculum with no lab work would be seriously deficient since
          experiment is the test of validity in science. Similarly mathematics without
          proof is severely deficient, indeed it is not mathematics.</p>

          <h2><a name="technique"></a>Developing technique</h2>

          <p>About a third to a half of any math course deals with technique---the process
          of making theorems work for you in specific situations rather than in the
          general setting in which they are usually stated. Sometimes this is fairly
          easy: many proofs give explicit constructions which you follow for the
          special case. In these situations the only problems are with algebraic
          and trigonometric manipulations and keeping track of where you are in the
          process. In other situations (technique of integration is a good example)
          there are lots of approaches which might apply to a given problem and several
          tricks which might be used to make the problem more tractable. For these
          you need to develop judgment.</p>

          <h3>Step 1. Read through the theorems and examples.</h3>

          <p>Some students make the whole process of learning how to do problems more
          difficult by acting like it had no connection with the other material in
          the course. Often problems follow a pattern which is given explicitly in
          the proof of the major theorem they follow. Knowing the general pattern
          in advance is easier than trying to find it by trial and error.</p>

          <h3>Step 2. Work enough problems to master the technique.</h3>
          <p>At this stage you should work enough problems so that the single technique
          which the problems illustrate is firmly in your mind. Since you have ultimate
          responsibility for your education, you should take the initiative to work
          enough problems for your own practice needs. This may well be more problems
          than are assigned to be turned in.</p>

          <h3>Step 3. Work a few problems in as many different ways as possible.</h3>

          <p>Too often the practice obtained in step 2 leads the student to think that
          there is only one approach to each problem. Sometimes one approach is easy
          and another is complicated, but often several different attacks will work
          equally well. Complicated approaches give the student practice in solving
          problems which take more than one step and more than one technique.</p>

          <h3>Step 4. Make yourself a set of randomly chosen problems.</h3>

          <p>One difficulty with learning many techniques to solve a particular kind
          of problem is that you have to figure out which technique to use before
          you can get to work on a solution. This is exacerbated by the tendency
          for problems to be grouped so that the appropriate technique to use is
          the one which immediately preceded the problem set. Putting two or three
          problems from each of the problem sets in a chapter on technique on 3 by
          5 cards and then shuffling the cards will give you a set of problems on
          which to practice deciding which technique to use.</p>

          <h2><a name="final"></a>A few final suggestions</h2>

          <p>Mathematical prose has a very low redundancy rate and mathematics is a
          very cumulative subject. Pay close attention as you read---once introduced,
          a concept is rarely repeated and it will be assumed later. Allow yourself
          adequate time to read the book before starting the problems.</p>

          <p>Few students write fast enough to get complete and readable notes in
          class. For this reason it is useful to go back over your class notes shortly
          after each class and make a complete, clean copy with all of the definitions
          and theorems clearly stated. This practice will also help you identify
          parts you don't understand so you can ask your professor about them in
          a timely fashion.</p>

          <p>Do not let yourself fall behind. Mathematics requires precision, habits
          of clear thought, and practice. Cramming for an exam will not only fail
          to produce the desired result on the exam, it will also reinforce a bad
          habit---that of trying to do mathematics by memorization rather than understanding.
          A good night's sleep and a clear head will serve you better than last minute
          memorization.</p>
