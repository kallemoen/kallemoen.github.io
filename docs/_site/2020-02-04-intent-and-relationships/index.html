<p>While reflecting on the past year, I realized I had spent a lot of time with people I didn’t enjoy spending time with.</p>

<p>It sucked for both parties, and it stole time I could have invested in people that matter.</p>

<p>It became very clear to me why this had happened after making three lists.</p>

<p>On the first list, I wrote down all the people that played a role in my life.</p>

<p>On the second list, I grouped the same people in three tiers, based on how much they mattered to me.
On the third list, I grouped them based on how often I spend time with them. Weekly, monthly, or quarterly.</p>

<p>I went into it thinking that I must be spending the most time with people that matter most, but the reality was that it was completely random.</p>

<p>That’s when I realized that my entire life, I’ve left my relationships up to chance. Spending time with whoever happens to be around at the time.</p>

<p>This year I’m doing something different. At the start of every week, I look at the list of people that matter the most and ask myself “What can I do this week to strengthen these relationships?”.</p>

<p>The people around us are the most important part of our lives, without them nothing else matters. Why leave them up to chance?</p>
