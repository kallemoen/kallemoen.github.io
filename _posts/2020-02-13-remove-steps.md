If you want someone to take a particular action, remove as many steps needed to take that action as you can.

When booking a meeting, instead of saying “When are you available?”, say “I’m available between 1–3pm, let me know a time between those intervals that work for you and I’ll send you a calendar invite.”.

By front-loading the work you remove friction. Not only are you showing respect for their time, but you’re also increasing your chance of the meeting happening.

What actions do you want your boss, friends, or clients to take? Are you adding friction you could easily mitigate?
