If you’ve ever done a project on your own, you know that motivation follows an oscillating pattern.
Some days are glorious, others are shit.

Depending on your situation, the valleys can get so deep you eventually throw in the towel. Here’s how that typically looks:

Something peculiar happens when you are two people vested in a project.

Rarely does the lines of the motivational valleys line up, they’re often out of sync.

When your morale is low, your partner’s morale is high and vice versa. You pull each other up when it’s needed.

Like real waves, they cancel each other out, and you’re left with a calmer sea. One which doesn’t rip your boat apart before you reach your destination.

Like all models, this doesn’t perfectly represent reality, but one thing is clear –if you want to go far, go together.
